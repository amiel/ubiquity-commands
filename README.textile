h1. Various Ubiquity Commands

Here are some of my ubiquity commands, I'd like to figure out how to make it possible to subscribe directly from this git repos as gists do, maybe I can link up a gist for each one?

h2. Javascript Enable / Disable

Allows you to easily enable or disable javascript from ubiquity as opposed to opening your browser preferences. Just type "javascript enable" or "javascript disable".
